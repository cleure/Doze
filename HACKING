Class / Function Hierarchy
========================================

doze.py
    DozeError(Exception) - General purpose exception for internal errors. Should
        definitely be extended in the future to multiple exceptions.

    ExceptionWrapper - Decorator for wrapping an external exception handler on
        class methods.
    
    TableContext - Independent class for setting and referencing table contexts,
        such as those used in JOINS.

backend/generic/base.py:
    IterableField - Helper class, for iterating over fields to determine various
        states, such as inside_quote, inside_parenthesis, etc
    
    BaseClause - Base for classes in backend.generic.py such as Join, Where, and
        Builder. Includes commonly used generic methods for handling field
        aliases and detecting SQL functions.

backend/generic/where.py:
    Where - Class for handling WHERE clauses, for generic database backends.
        Should suffice for most backends.

backend/generic/join.py:
    Join - Class for handling JOIN clauses, for generic database backends.
        Should suffice for most backends.

backend/generic/builder.py:    
    Builder - Class for interacting with database objects, for generic database
        backends. Will likely need to be extended by a backend-specific class
        in order to implement backend-specific behavior, such as checking if
        the connection is still open, obtaining server-side cursors, and
        handling asynchronous database connections. Look at the pgsql backend,
        if you're interested in implementing a new backend, to get an idea of
        what will be involved.
    
    QueryResult - Class for fetching results from a query. Database backends
        will likely need to extend this to implement backend-specific code.

backend/pgsql.py
    PostgreSQL specific backend, using psycopg2.
    
    connection_is_open - Function for checking if a database connection is
        currently open.
    
    connection_is_ready - Function for checking if a database connection is
        currently ready to accept new commands, create cursors, etc. Useful for
        asynchronous connections.

backend/mysql.py
    MySQL specific backend, using MySQLdb. The backend driver may be switched
    in the future, due to MySQLdb's inability to handle asynchronous
    connections.
