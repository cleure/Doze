* The BaseClause class needs to be overridable for database specific backends
* Properly handle fields when they're quoted
    * MySQL and PostgreSQL have different table / column quoting characters:
        MySQL: `table`.`column` = 'something'
        PostgreSQL: "table"."column" = 'something'
* Better in-code documentation
* Asynchronous connection support for MySQL (would require a driver besides MySQLdb)
