* Implement expression recognition, such as:
    SELECT 1 = 1; 
    SELECT ('foo' = 'bar')
    SELECT CASE WHEN field = 1 THEN 'foo' ELSE 'bar' END AS field
    
    * In order to do this, backend specific WHERE operators need to be accessible
        from the generic backend somehow.
* Recognize /field/ AS /alias/? SELECT a AS b, etc.
* Update in-code documentation (is out of date).
* Setup per-method unit-tests, to make sure everything works as expected.
* Properly handle fields when they're quoted
* Better in-code documentation
* Asynchronous connection support for MySQL (would require a driver besides MySQLdb)
