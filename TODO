* Properly implement backends. Currently, "generic" is the only one usable, while the API id being drafted.
    * MySQL and PostgreSQL both have different methods for server-side cursors:

    * MySQL and PostgreSQL have different table / column quoting characters:
        MySQL: `table`.`column` = 'something'
        PostgreSQL: "table"."column" = 'something'
* Properly handle fields when they're quoted
* Function the implements "encapsulate", which would be suitable to be used as a method decorator. Needs to be used to properly build sub-queries, or queries like: WHERE id = 5 OR (parent = 5 AND visible = 1)
