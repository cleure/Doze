* Implement asTuple, asDict, in addition to asObject and cursor().
* Experiment with Excel/CSV to database mapper.
* BaseClause.isSqlFunction() will return True, if parameter passed is a subquery.
    This behavior needs to be fixed. Perhaps by a method "isSubQuery"?
* Ensure that MySQL double-quotes are now being recognized by the IterableField
    class.
* Implement utility functions, for getting information about tables, indexes, etc.
* Consider renaming JOIN variable names. JOIN_INNER eventually evaluates to
    INNER JOIN, which seems retarded. Calling it INNER_JOIN would make more sense.
* Cleanup Where class.
* Cleanup Join class.
* Cleanup BaseClause class.
* Support Common Table Expression Write queries (DELETE, etc)
    http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/queries-with.html
* Implement more powerful sql expression detection
* Recognize /field/ AS /alias/? SELECT a AS b, etc.
* Update in-code documentation (is out of date).
* Setup per-method unit-tests, to make sure everything works as expected.
* Better in-code documentation
* Asynchronous connection support for MySQL (would require a driver besides MySQLdb)
