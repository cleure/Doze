* Consider rewriting BaseClause class.
* Use preProcessSql() method for setting tableContext on all objects, not just
    Joins.
* Consider renaming JOIN variable names. JOIN_INNER eventually evaluates to
    INNER JOIN, which seems retarded. Calling it INNER_JOIN would make more sense.
* Cleanup Where class.
* Cleanup Join class.
* Cleanup BaseClause class.
* Support Common Table Expression Write queries (DELETE, etc)

* Implement more powerful sql expression detection
* Recognize /field/ AS /alias/? SELECT a AS b, etc.
* Update in-code documentation (is out of date).
* Setup per-method unit-tests, to make sure everything works as expected.
* Better in-code documentation
* Asynchronous connection support for MySQL (would require a driver besides MySQLdb)
