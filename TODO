* Implement expression recognition, such as:
    SELECT 1 = 1; 
    SELECT ('foo' = 'bar')
    
    * In order to do this, backend specific WHERE operators need to be accessible
        from the generic backend somehow.
* Setup per-method unit-tests, to make sure everything works as expected.
* Properly handle fields when they're quoted
    * MySQL and PostgreSQL have different table / column quoting characters:
        MySQL: `table`.`column` = 'something'
        PostgreSQL: "table"."column" = 'something'
* Better in-code documentation
* Asynchronous connection support for MySQL (would require a driver besides MySQLdb)
